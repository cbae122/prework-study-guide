## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation is the opportunity to learn code. Code is something I've always followed and closely watched. This time I am taking a chance on a passion I've buried.
I built this project to learn not only about code but test myself that learning to code is something I've always wanted.
This project solves any doubts I may have had about starting to code.
I learned that I should have started coding sooner. The ability to create something I can use daily is an amazing feeling.
